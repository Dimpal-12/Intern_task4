# 📌 Internship Task 4 - Machine Learning Model Implementation

This repository contains my work for **CODTECH Internship - Task 4**, where I implemented a **Machine Learning model** using scikit-learn to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Spam detection is a classic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** problem. The goal is to identify and filter unwanted messages.  
In this project, I used the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Results
- **Accuracy:** ~97%  
- **Classification Report:**  
  - High precision and recall for both spam and ham  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Most messages classified correctly

## 📖 Steps to Run
1. Download the dataset: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)  
   Save it as **`spam.csv`** in your project folder.  

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   python spam_detection.py
or open spam_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
The script will output:
Accuracy score
Classification report
Confusion matrix (visualized)
📜 Deliverables
✅ Python code (task4_code.pdf)
✅ Output results (task4_output.pdf)
✅ Report (task4_report.pdf)
✅ GitHub README.md
📌 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to build a predictive ML model for spam detection using scikit-learn.
Future improvements can include:
Using TF-IDF features
Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
Deep learning approaches (LSTMs, Transformers)
